# Address Book Application

I will be creating an application that utilizes Ruby on Rails that functions as an API that accepts and sends requests via JSON. I will use PostgreSQL as my database connection. Listed below is my requirement for this project and helpful resources I found along the way. I'm always happy to share helpful tools that I find along when learning something new! 

## Requirements 
- PSQL
- Ruby on Rails 
- Written Tests for the Application
- 4 entities with corresponding relationships
- CRUD capabilities on each entity
- AJAX implementations
- Simple Authentication & Authorization (from scratch)
- Bootstap
- Responsive Design
